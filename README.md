# CS 381 Computer Vision

This is my repository for all of my work in the computer vision class.

## How to run and test

For any given project, go into the directory, compile with `make` and run with proper input and output files. For example to run project 8 chain code compression:

```zsh
% cd 8-chain-code
% make
% ./bin/main data/img1CC.txt data/img1Property.txt output/out1.txt output/chain1.txt output/boundary1.txt output/log1.txt
```
